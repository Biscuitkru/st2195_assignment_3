# st2195_assignment_3

This is done with reference to Data Expo 2009 data, and the Harvard Dataverse(https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7)

1. Create a folder called “r_sql” with a R code for constructing the database (from the csv inputs) and replicating the queries in the practice quiz 
   (see Additional Notes section for list of queries Q1 to Q4). The latter should be done both using DBI and dplyr notation [1.75 points each]
   
2. Create a folder called “python_sql” with a Python version of the code in point 2, based on sqlite3 [1.75 points]

3. A simplified solution for the query in Q4 in either R or Python (placed either in the R or Python *_sql folder) [1.75 points]
   Note that the database file should not be placed in the GitHub repository (it is quite large). 
   Also, the R and Python scripts should save the output of the queries in csv within their respective folders [1 point each].
